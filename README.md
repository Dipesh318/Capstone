The reason i choose this project is that i wanted to work on something that require more that 3-4 models and relations between them as, I was not comfortable with the models relations.
In this project, almost each and every model is related to some other model

with the help of bootstrap, I tried to make the project as mobile reponsive as possible

This project is build using django, javascript, HTMl and CSS
